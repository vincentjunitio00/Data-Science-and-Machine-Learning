Hey guys! Today, I will be sharing the most recently used functions in **pandas**. At the end of this notebook, you should have these following skills:
* Create your own dataframe
* Import a file into a dataframe
* Insert a column to the dataframe
* Insert a row to the dataframe
* Drop a column or row
* Export your dataframe into *.csv*, *.txt*, *.json* file

I am using **Google Colab** since we do not need any installation, but please have your device connected to the internet. :)

If you are new to Data Science and its related field, learning **pandas** is one of the most essential skills needed and this notebook should be your first baby step to dive in these world.

**Please Save a copy in Drive so you can edit in the notebook as well.**
**File** -> **Save a copy in Drive**

**You can simply click Runtime** -> **Run All, but since there are some "exercises" it will be better for you to run every cell step by step.** :D
